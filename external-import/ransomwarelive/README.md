## Installation

### Requirements

- OpenCTI Platform >= 6.7.6

### Configuration

Configuration parameters are provided using environment variables as described below.
Some of them are placed directly in the `docker-compose.yml` since they are not expected to be modified by final users once that they have been defined by the developer of the connector.

Note that the values that follow can be grabbed within Python code using `self.helper.{PARAMETER}` i.e., `self.helper.connector_nane`.

Expected environment variables to be set in the  `docker-compose.yml` that describe the connector itself.
Most of the time, these values are NOT expected to be changed.

| Parameter         | Docker envvar     | Mandatory | Description                              |
|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| `connector_name`  | `CONNECTOR_NAME`  | Yes       | A connector name to be shown in OpenCTI. |                                                                                                                   |
| `connector_scope` | `CONNECTOR_SCOPE` | Yes       | Supported scope. E. g., `text/html`.     |
 |

However, there are other values which are expected to be configured by end users.
The following values are expected to be defined in the `.env` file.
This file is included in the `.gitignore` to avoid leaking sensitive date. 
Note tha the `.env.sample` file can be used as a reference.

The ones that follow are connector's generic execution parameters expected to be added for export connectors.

| Parameter                    | Docker envvar                    | Mandatory | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `opencti_url`                | `OPENCTI_URL`                    | Yes       | The URL of the OpenCTI platform. Note that final `/` should be avoided. Example value: `http://opencti:8080`                                                                  |
| `opencti_token`              | `OPENCTI_TOKEN`                  | Yes       | The default admin token configured in the OpenCTI platform parameters file.                                                                                                   |
| `connector_id`               | `CONNECTOR_ID`                   | Yes       | A valid arbitrary `UUIDv4` that must be unique for this connector.                                                                                                            |
| `connector_log_level`        | `CONNECTOR_LOG_LEVEL`            | Yes       | The log level for this connector, could be `debug`, `info`, `warn` or `error` (less verbose).                                                                                 |
| `interval`                   | `CONNECTOR_RUN_EVERY`            | Yes       | The time unit is represented by a single character at the end of the string: d for days, h for hours, m for minutes, and s for seconds. e.g., 30s is 30 seconds. 1d is 1 day. |


Finally, the ones that follow are connector's specific execution parameters expected to be used by this connector.

| Parameter             | Docker envvar                   | Mandatory | Description                                              |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `create_threat_actor` | `CONNECTOR_CREATE_THREAT_ACTOR` | No        | Whether to create a Threat Actor object (Default: false) |
| `pull_history`        | `CONNECTOR_PULL_HISTORY`        | No        | Whether to pull historic data (Default: false)           |
| `data_start_year`     | `CONNECTOR_HISTORY_START_YEAR`  | No        | The year to start from (Default: 2020)                   |

### Debugging

The connector can be debugged by setting the appropriate log level.
Note that logging messages can be added using `self.helper.log_{LOG_LEVEL}("Sample message")`, i.e., `self.helper.log_error("An error message")`.
